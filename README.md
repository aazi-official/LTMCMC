# L-TMCMC for 1D Magnetotelluric Inversion

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of Langevin Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (L-TMCMC) for solving 1D Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion problems. The algorithm enhances the original TMCMC method by introducing gradient-based Langevin proposals to improve sampling efficiency and convergence.

The code supports full posterior sampling of layer resistivities and thicknesses based on apparent resistivity and phase data.

Simply run the main script in MATLAB:

Geophysical inversion is a critical technique in reconstructing subsurface physical properties from indirect measurements, with diverse applications in natural resources exploration, such as mineral exploration and hydrocarbon prospecting. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, a popular Bayesian inference method, has been widely used for geophysical inversion due to its ability of uncertainty quantification. Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method often suffers from slow convergence and high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose the Langevin Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (LTMCMC) method, which integrates gradient-based proposals to enhance sampling efficiency while preserving robust uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first validate LTMCMC on synthetic benchmark functions, including the Rosenbrock and Beale functions, both of which exhibit complex parameter landscapes with multiple local minima. By comparing LTMCMC with standard TMCMC, we demonstrate that LTMCMC achieves faster convergence and improved parameter estimation accuracy. We then apply LTMCMC to a synthetic study using geophysical magnetotelluric (MT) data. The proposed method successfully recovers major resistivity transitions in a multi-layer subsurface model, aligning well with true geological structures. Last, we conduct a field application using magnetotelluric data collected over the Cocos Plate offshore Nicaragua. The estimated subducting Cocos Plate boundary is consistent with the previous study. The developed LTMCMC provides reliable uncertainty quantification, offering confidence intervals for estimated parameters. This study highlights the advantages of LTMCMC in geophysical inversion, balancing computational speed with uncertainty assessment.
